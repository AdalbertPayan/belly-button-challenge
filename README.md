Module 14 challenge

Graders, the code in this challenge was either derived from Bills lectures or from the files in Module 14 - Interactive Visualizations.
I was able to use Chat GPT to help me fix some of the code that was not working but overall everything can be found in the files from Unit 14.

Please reach out with any questions or concerns.
